## Introduction

The sample code for Node.js encapsulates the server-side APIs of Push Kit, for your reference or direct use.

The following table describes packages of Node.js sample code.
| Package| Description
| ---- | ----- 
| examples|Sample code packages.
| utils|Package that provides methods for sending public network requests and for common verification.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run build

Note that the Node.js sample code can be used only in the server-side or background environments that you control, including most servers and serverless platforms (both on-premise and in the cloud).

## Configuration

Start configuration with the **index.ts** file. Create an **HcmNamespace** object, and call the methods in the object to perform initialization. Access different modules, such as the messaging or topic module, and call the methods in each module.

To use the functions provided by the packages in **examples**, set initialization and request parameters in the **config.js** file.
